    "loan_message": "1. Quick Pay is a special feature provided by Palm Mithra so that our farmers can get payment for their FFB supplied within 24 hours. \n2. Complete calculation and value of payment will be mentioned in the receipt in the app. The receipt requires a digital signature of the farmer, which signifies agreement to all terms and conditions. In case a Palm Mithra  representative is raising a Quick Pay request on behalf of the farmer, then a 4-digit PIN number will be sent to the registered mobile number of the farmer. This will act as confirmation of the agreement to all terms and conditions. \n3. To avail of this offer, there is a flat transaction fee on actuals and a per-ton Quick Pay fee. \n4. Quick Pay will be paid based on the prevalent ad-hoc rate. In case the ad-hoc rate is not yet known, Quick Pay will be based on an assumed ad-hoc rate. It will be adjusted based on the Government Order rate as and when declared. When the Invoice Rate is declared, that adjustment will also take place, and will be paid or deducted along with future payments (normal or Quick Pay). \n5. At least one unpaid collection is required to request Quick Pay. In case of more than one unpaid collection, Quick Pay request will apply to all pending unpaid collections. \n6. In order to be eligible for Quick Pay, FFB payment value should be greater than any against FFB deductions. \n7.All deductions such as fertilizers, poles and labour requests that were done against FFB will be reduced from the FFB payment while making quick pay payment.\n8. If Quick Pay has already been requested, another Quick Pay request cannot be made until the first one is completed. \n9. Once Quick Pay has been requested, it cannot be canceled. \n10. Quick Pay is not available on the date when the company is processing regular farmers' payments. Those dates will occur twice a month according to the regular pay cycle. \n11. In case a labor service or product purchase was recently done against FFB, it might not show in this payout statement because it is still under process. However, it will be deducted during Quick Pay payout. For details, please see your farmer ledger.",
